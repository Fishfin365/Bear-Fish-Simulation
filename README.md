# Bear-Fish-Simulation
this simulates a fish and bear population and how they interact on a grid

it creates instances of a fish with fish.py and the image for it from fish.gif,
and instances of a bear with bear.py and the image for it from bear.gif

it then makes a "world" grid with the size and characteristics from the world.py 

livealittle.py basically makes it so they randomly do their actions (eat, move, and die) 
because it is simulating animals.

it then puts them all together using the bearfishsimulation.py to run the whole program. 
you can change some parameters in the file 
-how long you want to run it
-how many starting fish and bear there are
-how big the "world" grid is
